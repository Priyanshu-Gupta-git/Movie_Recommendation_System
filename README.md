# Movie Recommendation System
## Overview
A Recommendation System is a critical area of research and application, playing a vital role in helping people make informed, automated decisions. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to process vast amounts of data and provide users with personalized recommendations that are beneficial to them.

When it comes to movie recommendation systems, these systems use similarity measures to find and recommend movies based on user preferences and behaviors. This can be done through collaborative filtering, which identifies similarities between users and their movie choices, or through content-based filtering, which focuses on the attributes of the movies themselves.


## Features
Utilizes a combination of text preprocessing and machine learning techniques to recommend movies.

Uses the TMDb 5000 Movies dataset.

Provides visual representation of the top recommended movies with similarity scores.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following packages installed:
pandas

scikit-learn

nltk

matplotlib

seaborn

### pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn

## How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Download the TMDb 5000 Movies dataset and save the files tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv in the same directory as your script.

Run the script to load the data, preprocess it, and train the recommendation model.
